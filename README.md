# Introduction

This is a project generated by [salvo-cli](https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo-cli). You can run the program and test according to the following commands (for non-sqlite databases, please modify the database connection string first according to the tutorial, and complete the initial work of the data).
üòÑ The latest version of Salvo requires Rust version 1.75. If your compilation fails, please try upgrading with `rustup update`.

```shell
//Run the project
cargo run
```

# Tip

- If you choose sqlite or have initialized the data in the users table, please use the account zhangsan with password 123 to login.
- The database connection string is in config/config.toml, but if you use sqlx or seaorm, the library itself reads the configuration from .env file to generate entities, run migrations, and validate. So when you modify the database connection string, you need to change two places at the same time.

# orm doc or home page link

üêö You have chosen sea-orm, documentation can be viewed here:https://www.sea-ql.org/SeaORM/docs/index/

## sea_orm_cli

For SeaOrm-cli related database migration, automatic entity creation and other commands, please check the documentation https://www.sea-ql.org/SeaORM/docs/migration/running-migration/#command-line-interface-cli

## Data initialization

- Please first modify the database connection string in .env and config/config.toml
- Ensure the database exists and then run sea-orm migration to restore the database, and execute the sql file in the /data folder to add the default data to the database.
- After running, you can access /login using the default username:zhangsan and password:123.
- For more sea-orm-cli features, please check /migration/README.md.
