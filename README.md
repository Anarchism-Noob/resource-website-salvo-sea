# Introduction

This is a project generated by [salvo-cli](https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo-cli). You can run the program and test according to the following commands (for non-sqlite databases, please modify the database connection string first according to the tutorial, and complete the initial work of the data).
üòÑ The latest version of Salvo requires Rust version 1.75. If your compilation fails, please try upgrading with `rustup update`.

```shell
//Run the project
cargo run
```

# Tip

- I'm a rookie, this is my first website written in rusty language and there are a lot of unresolved issues in it. This project is not yet complete, my ability to progress is limited, and I'm stuck with jwt_auth in Router. The project is expected to use USDT as the currency, but I haven't figured out how to implement it yet. (Also: I'd like to make this project run on Docker, but I can't write a dockerfile)
